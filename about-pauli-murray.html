<!-- Biography -->
<section style="padding: 60px 20px; max-width: 900px; margin: auto; line-height: 1.7;">
  <p><strong>Anna Pauline “Pauli” Murray (1910–1985)</strong> was a groundbreaking Black, queer, nonbinary legal theorist, civil rights activist, writer, and Episcopal priest whose visionary work shaped some of the most important social justice movements of the 20th century — often without receiving due credit in their lifetime.</p>
  <p>Born in Baltimore, Maryland, and raised in Durham, North Carolina, Murray lost both parents early in life and was raised by an aunt who was a teacher and activist. From a young age, Murray’s life was marked by resistance to injustice and a fierce intellectual curiosity that would define their legacy.</p>

  <h2>A Scholar and Legal Pioneer</h2>
  <p>Denied admission to the University of North Carolina due to their race, Murray wrote a scathing letter that gained national attention — foreshadowing a lifetime of strategic legal advocacy. They eventually graduated from Hunter College (1933) and later became the only woman in their Howard University School of Law class (1944), graduating first in the class. Despite this, Murray was denied admission to Harvard Law due to gender — an experience that crystallized their understanding of intersectional oppression before the term existed.</p>
  <p>Murray coined the concept of “Jane Crow”, to describe the dual oppressions of racism and sexism that Black women face. Their senior thesis at Howard, arguing that the “separate but equal” doctrine should be overturned, directly influenced Thurgood Marshall and the legal strategy behind Brown v. Board of Education. Later, as the first African American to receive a JSD from Yale Law School (1965), Murray became a leading legal theorist whose ideas were cited in landmark civil rights cases.</p>

  <h2>Architect of Justice</h2>
  <p>Their 1950 book, <em>States’ Laws on Race and Color</em>, was hailed by Thurgood Marshall as the “bible” of the civil rights movement. While still a law student at Howard, Murray wrote a third-year thesis that segregation violated the 14th Amendment — that thesis laid the groundwork for <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>. They co-founded the National Organization for Women (NOW) in 1966 and influenced Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s gender equality litigation.</p>

  <h2>Writer and Poet</h2>
  <p>Murray was also a powerful memoirist and poet. Their works include <em>Proud Shoes</em>, a family history that interrogates race in America, and <em>Dark Testament</em>, a collection of spiritual and political poems.</p>

  <h2>Spiritual Trailblazer</h2>
  <p>In 1977, Murray became the first Black woman — and first known LGBTQ+ person — ordained as an Episcopal priest. Their ordination embodied a radical theology of liberation, inclusion, and queer Black faith.</p>

  <h2>Gender, Queerness, and Legacy</h2>
  <p>In private writings, Murray expressed a deep sense of being male-identified and sought hormone treatments. Today, they are often honored as a nonbinary or transmasculine ancestor whose identity challenged binaries long before such language existed.</p>
  <p>Murray died in 1985. In 2012, they were canonized in the Episcopal Church. Their life and legacy are preserved in the documentary <em>My Name Is Pauli Murray</em> and through institutions, movements, and curricula inspired by their prophetic vision.</p>
